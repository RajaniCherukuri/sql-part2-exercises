This database was created with data from a dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/fivethirtyeight/uber-pickups-in-new-york-city). The dataset was made using data obtained from the NYC Taxi and Limosine Commission or TLC. TLC tracks this data by base and even rideshare companies such as Uber and Lyft have assigned bases that each pickup must be attributed to. For the exercises, we will be using the `other-FHV-services-jan-july15` and `lyft` tables in RideShareDB.Â These tables include the data for each pickup attributed to a few other For-Hire Vehicles (FHV) services and Lyft. These tables do not include any data from Uber.\n",
